## Overview:
The **Pokémon Storage System** is a console-based application that simulates a **Pokémon storage system**, allowing users to manage their Pokémon by depositing and withdrawing them into storage boxes. This project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and connects to **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, promoting sustainable practices, responsible resource management, and waste reduction through an engaging Pokémon-themed interface.

---

## OOP Principles Applied:
This project demonstrates several key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:

| **Principle**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | The **`Pokemon`** class encapsulates attributes such as name, types, level, and held items, while using methods (getters and setters) to control access. |
| **Inheritance**   | The **`Pokemon`** class serves as a base for other Pokémon types, allowing for easy extension and customization for more specific behaviors.          |
| **Polymorphism**  | The **`SpecialPokemon`** class demonstrates polymorphism by overriding the `toString` method, displaying a Pokémon’s unique special abilities.    |
| **Abstraction**   | The **`Pokemon`** class is abstract, providing a blueprint for creating different types of Pokémon, focusing on their storage and management.         |

## SDG Integration: SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production
This project is aligned with **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, which focuses on **sustainable resource management** and **minimizing waste**. The **Pokémon Storage System** encourages players to manage their Pokémon efficiently, limiting the number of Pokémon that can be stored in a box at once and ensuring no overuse of space. This mirrors the real-world concept of **managing finite resources** in a sustainable and responsible manner.

### Key ways this project integrates SDG 12:
| **SDG Concept**            | **Project Application**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Management**    | Just as businesses must manage resources, the system enforces **limits on storage capacity**, ensuring that players cannot exceed the set capacity of the boxes. |
| **Waste Minimization**     | The system encourages players to make thoughtful decisions about what Pokémon to store or withdraw, minimizing waste by using storage efficiently.     |
| **Educational Value**      | The game helps children understand **sorting, managing, and reducing waste** in a fun and engaging way, teaching important life skills on sustainability and resource management. |

## Instructions for Running the Program:

### What the Program Does:
The **Pokémon Storage System** allows players to manage their Pokémon through a **virtual Pokémon PC system**. The game is organized into three main actions: **Depositing Pokémon**, **Withdrawing Pokémon**, and **Managing Items**.

| **Action**                | **Description**                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View Pokémon Storage**  | Displays the current contents of the Pokémon boxes (up to 2 Pokémon per box).                              |
| **Deposit Pokémon**       | Allows the user to deposit a Pokémon from their party into one of the boxes, with a capacity of 2 Pokémon per box. |
| **Withdraw Pokémon**      | Lets the user withdraw a Pokémon from a box and add it back to the party, with a maximum of 6 Pokémon in the party. |
| **Deposit Item**          | Users can assign an item to a Pokémon in the party and transfer it to a Pokémon in the storage boxes.      |
| **Withdraw Item**         | Lets the user withdraw an item from a Pokémon in the storage box. The item can then be assigned to a Pokémon in the party or discarded. |
| **Exit**                  | Exits the program after a prompt confirming exit.                                                         |

### Steps to Run the Program:
1. **Clone the repository**:
   Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

2. **Compile the program**:
   Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Use the following command to compile the program:

3. **Run the program**:
   After compilation, run the program with:

4. **Interact with the system**:
   - The program will prompt you to input the number of Pokémon in your party.
   - After that, you can perform actions such as depositing and withdrawing Pokémon and items into/from the Pokémon PC system.
   - You can navigate through the menu using the number options provided and follow the prompts to manage your Pokémon storage.

## How the Game Works:

| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Managing Pokémon**      | You can store up to 2 Pokémon per box (with 3 boxes in total). The game prevents you from exceeding this capacity, encouraging critical thinking about space management. |
| **Depositing & Withdrawing Pokémon** | You can deposit and withdraw Pokémon from your party into the storage system while maintaining balance and organization. |
| **Item Management**       | Items can be assigned to Pokémon, and the game allows swapping items between Pokémon in your party and storage, emphasizing efficient resource use. |
