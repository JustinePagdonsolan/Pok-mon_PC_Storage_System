## Overview
The **Pokémon Storage System** is a console-based application that simulates a **Pokémon storage system**, allowing users to manage their Pokémon by depositing and withdrawing them into storage boxes. This project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and connects to **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, promoting sustainable practices, responsible resource management, and waste reduction through an engaging Pokémon-themed interface.

## OOP Principles Applied
This project demonstrates several key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles:

| **Principle**     | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | The **`Pokemon`** class encapsulates attributes such as name, types, level, and held items, while using methods (getters and setters) to control access. |
| **Inheritance**   | The **`Pokemon`** class serves as a base for other Pokémon types, allowing for easy extension and customization for more specific behaviors.          |
| **Polymorphism**  | Polymorphism is demonstrated in this system with the **`SpecialPokemon`** class, which extends the base **`Pokemon`** class. The `toString` method is overridden in the **`SpecialPokemon`** subclass to include a **special ability** attribute, which allows for different behaviors depending on the actual object type. |
| **Abstraction**   | The **`Pokemon`** class is abstract, providing a blueprint for creating different types of Pokémon, focusing on their storage and management.         |

## SDG Integration: SDG 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production
This project is aligned with **SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**, which focuses on **sustainable resource management** and **minimizing waste**. The **Pokémon Storage System** encourages players to manage their Pokémon efficiently, limiting the number of Pokémon that can be stored in a box at once and ensuring no overuse of space. This mirrors the real-world concept of **managing finite resources** in a sustainable and responsible manner.

### Key ways this project integrates SDG 12:
| **SDG Concept**            | **Project Application**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Management**    | Just as businesses must manage resources, the system enforces **limits on storage capacity**, ensuring that players cannot exceed the set capacity of the boxes. |
| **Waste Minimization**     | The system encourages players to make thoughtful decisions about what Pokémon to store or withdraw, minimizing waste by using storage efficiently.     |
| **Educational Value**      | The game helps children understand **sorting, managing, and reducing waste** in a fun and engaging way, teaching important life skills on sustainability and resource management. |

## Instructions for Running the Program

### What the Program Does
The **Pokémon Storage System** allows players to manage their Pokémon through a **virtual Pokémon PC system**. The game is organized into three main actions: **Depositing Pokémon**, **Withdrawing Pokémon**, and **Managing Items**.

<p align="center">
   <img src="https://pngimg.com/uploads/pokeball/pokeball_PNG29.png" width="250" height="250">  <!-- Pokéball Icon -->

| **Action**                | **Description**                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View Pokémon Storage**  | Displays the current contents of the Pokémon boxes (up to 2 Pokémon per box).                              |
| **Deposit Pokémon**       | Allows the user to deposit a Pokémon from their party into one of the boxes, with a capacity of 2 Pokémon per box. |
| **Withdraw Pokémon**      | Lets the user withdraw a Pokémon from the box and add it back to the party, with a maximum of 6 Pokémon in the party. |
| **Deposit Item**          | Users can assign an item to a Pokémon in the party and transfer it to a Pokémon in the storage boxes.      |
| **Withdraw Item**         | Lets the user withdraw an item from a Pokémon in the storage box. The item can then be assigned to a Pokémon in the party or discarded. |
| **Exit**                  | Exits the program after a prompt confirming exit.                                                         |

## How the Game Works

| **Feature**               | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Managing Pokémon**      | You can store up to 2 Pokémon per box (with 3 boxes in total). The game prevents you from exceeding this capacity, encouraging critical thinking about space management. |
| **Depositing & Withdrawing Pokémon** | You can deposit and withdraw Pokémon from your party into the storage system while maintaining balance and organization. |
| **Item Management**       | Items can be assigned to Pokémon, and the game allows swapping items between Pokémon in your party and storage, emphasizing efficient resource use. |

## Special Pokémon and Special Abilities
In addition to basic Pokémon management, the system also demonstrates the use of **polymorphism** with the **`SpecialPokemon`** class. 

- **`SpecialPokemon`** is a subclass that extends the base **`Pokemon`** class.
- It introduces a unique attribute, the **special ability**, which can represent various special powers a Pokémon might possess (e.g., "Fire Blast", "Thunder Shock").
- The **`toString`** method is overridden in **`SpecialPokemon`** to display the special ability of each Pokémon, differentiating it from regular Pokémon. This allows for different behaviors based on the specific Pokémon type.

## Interaction with the Program

Below are the detailed interactions and possible outcomes when using the Pokémon Storage System:

| **Interaction**                              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Pokémon in Party**               | Prompts user to enter how many Pokémon are in their party (1-6). Invalid inputs trigger retry prompts.                                                                  |
| **Entering Pokémon Details**                 | Collects Pokémon details such as name, type(s), level, and held item. Ensures validation for types and levels, prompting corrections for invalid inputs.                 |
| **Viewing Pokémon Storage**                  | Displays the contents of each storage box. Shows details of each Pokémon or displays "No Pokémon in this box" if the box is empty.                                      |
| **Depositing Pokémon**                       | Allows the user to deposit a Pokémon from their party into a storage box. Enforces box capacity limits (2 Pokémon per box) and validates inputs.                         |
| **Withdrawing Pokémon**                      | Enables withdrawal of Pokémon from a box to the party. Prevents withdrawal if the party already has 6 Pokémon or if the selected box is empty.                          |
| **Depositing Items**                         | Transfers an item from a Pokémon in the party to one in storage. Items are swapped if the storage Pokémon already holds an item, ensuring efficient item management.     |
| **Withdrawing Items**                        | Lets the user withdraw an item from a Pokémon in storage. Items can be reassigned to a party Pokémon or discarded, with swap functionality if a Pokémon is already holding an item. |
| **Special Pokémon Interaction**              | Displays special abilities of `SpecialPokemon` using polymorphism. Differentiates them from regular Pokémon through unique attributes.                                  |
| **Exiting the System**                       | Ends the session with a farewell message: "Thank you for using the Pokémon PC! Have a great adventure, Trainer!"                                                        |
